# Coding Practice – Learning Log

This repository is my personal learning log and sandbox for coding experiments. It's where I explore different programming languages, practice small tasks, and document what I'm learning as I go.

This isn't a polished project or a library - it's an evolving collection of code snippets, exercises, and walkthroughs that help me improve as a developer.

## About

Each folder in this repository focuses on a different language or technology. The scripts inside range from simple syntax experiments to small functional programs.

I use this repository to:

- Record what I've been learning
- Experiment with new ideas and tools
- Revisit old concepts and strengthen fundamentals
- Compare how different languages solve similar problems

## Folder Structure

```
CodingPractice/
├── csharp/         # C# experiments and test projects
├── html/           # HTML practice and structure demos
├── javascript/     # JavaScript snippets and exercises
├── perl/           # Perl scripting practice
├── php/            # PHP mini projects and tests
├── powershell/     # PowerShell automation and experiments
├── python/         # Python challenges and tutorials
├── ruby/           # Ruby language practice
├── shell/          # Bash and shell scripting
└── sql/            # SQL query practice
```

Each folder is self-contained - open it, explore the code, and run examples independently.

## Goals

- Build consistent coding habits  
- Learn through hands-on practice  
- Explore multiple programming languages  
- Keep a personal record of progress and experiments  
- Maintain a reference for future projects or revisiting concepts

## How to Use

If you'd like to explore or learn from this repository:

1. Browse by language folder  
2. Open any script to see examples or experiments  
3. Run scripts locally if you want to test or modify them  

Note: These scripts are for learning and experimentation only, not production use.

## Future Plans

- Continue adding new languages and technologies  
- Organise exercises by topic or concept  
- Add short notes or explanations to document what I learned from each section
